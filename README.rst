6 Columns baseline grid

This is my own css grid framework.

It comes in two versions:

- 13px text body / 1.4 line-height
- 16px text body / 1.4 line-height

Each column is 160px, with a gutter of 20px.

I tried to be very light, since I use this as a very starting-point of grid based web design.

A simple demo page is available here:
